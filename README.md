## Side Scan Sonar .jsf Reader written in Matlab

Matlab code for extracting data messages from ```.jsf``` files generated by EdgeTech side scan sonar systems.

The parser is developed based on the format specifications provided in EdgeTechâ€™s documentation: ```edge_tech_jsf_rev_2022.pdf``` (version dated June 17th, 2022).

## Info
Currently, only the following message types are supported:
- Type 80: Sonar data (fully supported and decoded).
- Types 3000 and 3002: still under testing and validation.


## Usage
1. Run ```cookJsfDataset.m``` with the appropriate ```path``` and ```file```. To include message type 3000, set the variable ```type3000 = 1``` (default is ```1```).
    - Note: Type 80 is the primary message used for decoding. Support for 300x message types is optional.
    - Decoding and saving message types 300x can be time-consuming and may produce large .mat files (over 6 GB).
    - If message type 300x is not required, you can disable its parsing by commenting out the two ```elseif``` blocks handling it.
    
2. Run ```checkDataset.m``` to visualize the acoustic measurements.
